PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM

It is one of the problem of multi-process synchronization also known in the name of bounded-buffer problem. According 
to this problem there are two processes or active persons i.e producer and a consumer.

Producer is going to produce certain items and at that period of time while the producer is producing there are 
some constraint which are : 
1. No other producer is allowed to produce items at that time.
2. No consumer can consume the item.
Producer has the role to fill the buffer and the role of the consumer is to remove an item from the buffer.

When the consumer is consuming then the constraints are:
1. No other consumer can consume the data from the buffer.
2. No producer can produce the data.

Both producer and consumer processes need to be synchronized and we have different approaches to acheive it which are:
1. Using semaphores
2. Using monitors
3. Without semaphore or monitors

Using the above 3 methods we can solve this producer consumer problem without getting into a race-around condition
which ultimately leads to deadlock.
